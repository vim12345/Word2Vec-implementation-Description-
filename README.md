# Word2Vec-implementation-Description-

# Description:
Word2Vec is a neural network-based model that learns dense vector representations for words based on their context, capturing semantic relationships (e.g., "king - man + woman â‰ˆ queen"). In this project, we implement Word2Vec using Gensim to train embeddings on a sample corpus and visualize word similarities.

# ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
* Trains Word2Vec embeddings using Gensim on real-world text

* Captures semantic similarity between words

* Visualizes relationships using PCA
